# Example Yarn 3 Workspaces Monorepo + NPM Publish Workflow w/ Changesets

## Description

- Changesets for versioning and release
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Yarn for package management and Yarn 3 for managing multiple packages
- tsup 5 transpilation and bundling

## Set Up

**Requires Yarn 3**

1. Create [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#personal-access-tokens-classic) - add all permissions for `repo` scope and `read:user` for user scope

- Fine-grained access token does not work

2. Create a [NPM publish token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)
3. Add these to your [GitHub repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) (named as `GHP_TOKEN` and `NPM_PUBLISH_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
4. In GitHub repository settings, go to: actions -> general -> workflow permissions -> **Enable Read & Write Permissions**
5. It is _important_ to ensure correct values for `access` and `baseBranch` [config properties](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md)
6. (Optionally) Add [Changesets GitHub Bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) to the repo as a reminder for changes that do need changesets
7. Configure `changesetBaseRefs` for --since prop in `yarn workspaces foreach`

- Some changes are not relevant to a release (i.e. README updates) so they do not need changesets

## Typical Workflow for Versioning and Releases

**Contributor**:

1. Make desired changes to packages.
2. Run `yarn changeset` to version changes.
3. Create a PR for the change (or merge directly).

**Code Owner**:

1. As long as there are changesets on the main branch, there will be a PR open for committing a release. This PR will automatically update as changesets are added/removed.
2. When desired, merge the changesets `Release` PR to begin the release process.
3. After merging the PR: changesets on the main branch will be cleaned up, any changed packages will have a new NPM release, a GitHub release + tags will be added, and any relevant files will be updated (i.e. `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` version fields)
4. If you want to ever trigger a manual publish you can use `changesets publish` locally, however this will not auto-publish GitHub releases + tags for you.

## FAQ

1. **How many changesets per PR?** You should only typically generate one changeset per PR. Since it's a markdown file, you can easily edit it whenever to update the versioning or changelog notes.
2. **What happens if release fails**? The `GitHub Action` release workflow will fail, after investigating the logs and fixing it (i.e. maybe `npm token` wasn't configured correctly), you can re-run the workflow to publish any packages that weren't published.
